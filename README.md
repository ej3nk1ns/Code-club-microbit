# Code-club-microbit
Microbit code written for Code club projects

To see this code, browse to https://makecode.microbit.org/ and select 'New project'.  Separately, download the hex file from here to your device, and then drag it into the code editor part of your browser window (the space on the right with code blocks 'on start' and 'forever' already visible).

To run the code, attach a microbit to your device with a USB cable, and drag the hex file on to the microbit (either as downloaded, or re-download it from the browser window if you have made your own changes).
